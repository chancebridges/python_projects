# You can import every class from a module using the following syntax:
# from module_name import*

# This method is not recommended for two reasons. First it is helpful to 
# be able to read the import statement at the top of a file and get a clear
# sense of which classes a prpogram uses. This approach also leads to confusion
# with the names in the file. 

# If you need to import many classes form a module, you're better off
# importing the entire module and using the module_name.class_name syntax.
