# to start importing functions we need to create a module.

# a module is a file ending in .py that contains the code you want to import
# into your program.

# the pizza.py file contains the function make_pizza()

# next we will make a separate file called making_pizzas.py in the same 
# directory as pizza.py. 

# reference making_pizzas.py 

# this approach to importing, in which you simply write import followed by the
# name of the module, makes every function from the module available in 
# your program. 

# the syntax is : module_name.function_name()
