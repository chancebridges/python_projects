# when a program needs user input this is done using the input() function
# you can use pythons 'while' loop to keep programs running as long as certain conditions remain true


# the input function takes one argument: the prompt that we want to 
# display to the user so they know what to do. the program waits while the 
# user enters their response and continues after the user presses enter
