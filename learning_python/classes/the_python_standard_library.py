# the python standard library is a set of modules included with 
# every python installation. 

# You can use any function or class in the standard library by 
# importing a simple import statement at the top of your file. 

# Let's look at one class, OrderedDict, from the module collections.

# Dictionaries allow you to connect pieces of information, but they don't 
# keep track of the order in which you add key-value pairs. If you're creating
# a dictionary and want to keep track of the order in which key-value pairs
# are added, you can use the OrderedDict class from the collections module.

# Instances of the OrderedDict class behave almost exactly like dictionaries
# except they keep track of the order in which key-value pairs are added.
