# One common issue when working with files is handling missing files. 

# The file you're looking for may be in a different location, the filename
# may be misspelled, or the file may not exist at all. You can handle all of 
# these situations in a straightforward way with a try-except block

# Lets try to read a file that doesn't exist. The following program tries to 
# read in the contents of alice in wonderland

# Refernece alice.py
