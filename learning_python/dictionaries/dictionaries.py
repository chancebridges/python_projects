# a dictionairy in python is a collection of key-value pairs. each key is collected to a value
# a key's value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary
# in python a dictionary is wrapped in braces {}
# every key is connected to its value by a colon, and individual key-value pairs are separated by commas
# you can store as many key-value pairs as you want in a dictionary

alien_0 = {'color' : 'green'}
# in this dictionary the string 'color' is the key and the value is 'green'
