# If you want to add content to a file instead of writing over existing 
# content, you can open the file in append mode. 

# when you open a file in append mode, Python does not erase the file 
# before returning the file object. Any lines you write to the file will 
# be added at the end of the file. If the file does not exist yet, python 
# will create an empty file for you. 

# lets modify write_message.py by adding some new reasons we love programming
# to the existing file programming.txt

# reference write_message_2.py
