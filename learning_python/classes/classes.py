#object-oriented programming is one of the most effective approaches to writing
# software. in object oriented programming you write classes that represent
# real-world things and situations. and you create objects based on these classes

# when you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have 

# When you create individual objects from the class, each object is automatically equipped with the general behavior. 

# making an object from a class is called instantiation and you worko with 
# instances of a class.
