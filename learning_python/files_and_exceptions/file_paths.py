# When you pass a simple filename like pi_digits.txt to the open() function, 
# python looks in the firectory where the file thats currently being executed
# is stored.

# sometimes, depending on how you organize your work, the file you want to 
# open won't be in the same directory as your program file. 
# when this is the case, you need to provide a file path, which tells 
# python to look in a specific location on your system. 

# using absolut paths (reference file_reader.py), you can read files from any
# location on your system.
