# The __init__() method at line 36 has one parameter, battery_saze, in 
# addition to self. This is an optional parameter that sets the battery's
# size to 70 if no value is provided. 

# In line 53 we add an attribute called self.battery. This line tells Python
# to create a new instance of Battery (with a default size of 70) and store 
# that instance in the attribute self.battery

# line 53 tells python to look at the instance my_tesla, find its battery 
# attribute, and call the method describe_batery() that's associated with the 
# Battery instance stored in the attribute.
