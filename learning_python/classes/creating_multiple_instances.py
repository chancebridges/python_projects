# you can create as many instances from a class as you need.

# even if we used the same name and age for the second dog, python would 
# still create a separate instance from the Dog class. You can make as many
# instances from one class as you need, as long as you give each instance a 
# unique variable name or it occupies a unique spot in a list or dictionary.
