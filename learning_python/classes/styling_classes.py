# Class names should be writted in CamelCaps. To do this, capitalize the first
# letter of each word in the name, and do not use underscores.

# Instance and module names should be written in lowercase with underscores between words. 

# Every class should have a docstring immediately following the class 
# definition. The docstring should be a brief description of what the
# class does, and you should follow the same formatting conventions you used
# for writing docstrings in functions. 

# Each module should also have a docstring describing what the classes in a module can be used for. 

# typically use one blank line between methods and two blank lines between
# classes. 

# If you need to import a module from the standard library and a module from
# that you wrote, place the import statement for the standard library module
# first. Then add a blank line and then the import statement for the module
# you wrote.
